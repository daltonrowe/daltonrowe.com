    Bowling Green is a tertiary city in Kentucky where I went to college
    and met a beautiful group of people. BG has a grip of talented
    musicians creating art and performing live.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I transplant to BG, I got to know some of these people, and heard
    from them about the previous eras of music in BG, and their musical
    influences that are no longer active.
  </p>

      Creating the bgrad.io brand was one of my fav parts.

    This experience led to me to create an database of local bands and
    musicians, reach out to them and get their permission to stream their
    music.
  </p>

  <h2>Iteration 1: Youtube Stream</h2>

  <p>
    The first version of bgrad.io was a 24/7 Youtube stream. These streams
    were popular at the time with <em>beats to relax/study to</em> leading
    the charge.
  </p>

  <p>
    V1 was composed of some node scripts, a web interface, and OBS. I had
    a poor little Mac mini chugging away in my office for days at a time.
    Uptime was decent, but occasionally the next song would not play due
    to bugs in the node scripts.
  </p>

  <p>The Youtube stream had some cool features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="icon">🖼️</span> Album art display</li>
    <li><span class="icon">🏃‍♂️‍➡️</span> Art and title animation</li>
    <li><span class="icon">🎼</span> Album and artist information</li>
    <li>
      <span class="icon">🎥</span> Music videos support when available
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="icon">🧑‍🏫</span> Interesting facts displayed per album
      and artist
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Iteration 2: Azuracast Server</h2>

  <p>
    Eventually, I got tired having to host the stream locally in my own
    home. Occasional connection issues as well as network and power usage
    was less than ideal. To say nothing of the eventual copyright strikes
    I would attract on Youtube, despite having explicit permission from
    the rights holders.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I looked into rebuilding bgrad.io as a hostable internet radio
    station. I found <a href="https://www.azuracast.com/">Azuracast</a>, a
    great easy to roll streaming solution. I tossed it on a Digital Ocean
    droplet and redid the website, and let people know.
  </p>

  <p>
    The response was much greater this time, and people shared how they
    enjoyed getting to rediscover artists they hadn't heard in decades.
  </p>

  <p>Hopefully I revive this again in some form or another one day.</p>
