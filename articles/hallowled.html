  <p>
    At the beginning of our first year in Germany, we were informed
    Halloween was a big deal on the siedlung.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being fools for Halloween ourselves we bust out the decorations, and I
    whipped up a little script to play sound effects with synchronized
    lighting.
  </p>

  <blockquote>A couple people even took pictures!</blockquote>

  <p>Some of my favorite scenes:</p>

  <h2>WLED</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/aircoookie/WLED/" target="_blank">WLED</a>
    is an LED controller for ESP32/ESP8266. It has tons of built in
    effects and a good amount of customization. It provides a web UI for
    editing but also includes a JSON API!
  </p>

  <p>
    These prebuilt ESP32 boards with WLED already flashed made setup a
    breeze. Only needed to update OTA, setup the attached light strips,
    connect to the network!

  <h2>Networking</h2>

  <p>
    HalloWLED is a great starting point if you want to script some WLED
    instances via their API.
  </p>

  <p>
    It can run on a network, where a hostname for a node is required. It
    will then grab all other node IPs via the WLED API.
  </p>

  <p>
    I found updating each node directly to be more reliable then using
    WLED's built in sync, where occasionally a strip would not recieve the
    new effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally it can also run in direct AP mode, where it connects the
    WLED instance's wireless access point. For Trunk or Treat decorations,
    I ran a WLED + 120 LED strip off a pocket battery pack, and could have
    stayed lit for probably ~6 hours.

  <h2>Happy Halloween!</h2>

  <p>
    Its a basic project, but I did take some care and iterations to make
    it a good experience for viewers.
  </p>

  <p>
    It doesn't repeat effects back to back to ensure variety, and it swaps
    to a background scene in between effects in order to prevent effect
    lighting for outlasting its welcome.
  </p>

    I'm glad my little weekend project went off without a hitch, and made
    some young folks Halloween even more fun!
