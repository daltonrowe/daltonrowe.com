      <p>
        When the Coronavirus pandemic first hit and shutdowns began, no one knew
        how to react. Our local music venue and bar
        <a href="https://tidballs.com">Tidball's</a>, most known for being the
        starting point for Grammy award winning
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_the_Elephant"
          >Cage the Elephant</a
        >, decided to find new ways to reach their community.
      </p>

      <h2>Oh wait are we on?</h2>

      <p>
        Brain Jarvis, David Downing, Nathan Morguelan, Jessi Wurth and myself
        started hosting a twice weekly two-hour live steam featuring community
        music contributions, phone calls, and general zanyiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Truly a collabrotive mind-meld, ideas were abundant, passions high, some
        toes were stepped on but every member brought unique and essential
        aspects to the production. Truly a special moment for all us.
      </p>

          We figured out as we went how to wrangle the chaos of multi-camera
          live streaming.

      <p>
        The community involvement was truly life changing. Heartfelt messages
        during calls, a comment section with unmatched enthusiasm and
        dedication, and even an unforgettable message of love from a new father
        were all unexpected and greatly appreciated.
      </p>

      <p>And that's to say nothing of the music!</p>

      <h2>Homegrown Music</h2>

        Every town says their music community is special, but it's obvious the
        music community in Bowling Green <em>did</em> something special.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artists from around Bowling Green and beyond wrote, recorded and
        performed hours of content in their own homes, that we were lucky enough
        to share on stream. Collabrations between new and old friends produced
        some genuinely amazing pieces under extraordinary circumstances.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Overall we estimated around 180 hours of streaming in 2020.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        80% of that I'd say was community performances and contributions! I
        can't thank all the artists that contributed enough.
      </p>

      <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>

      <p>
        The community as well as the core crew at
        <a href="https://yellowberri.com">Yellowberi</a> put in tons of time and
        effort on special segments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fueled by Dang-Dangs (Jarvis special InsideOut concoction) the streams
        featured call in segments, on location out on the town shoots, over
        produced music videos, frantic police light backed rants against
        Zuckerburg and much more.
      </p>

      <h2>Christmas Finale</h2>
