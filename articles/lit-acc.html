    My wife had an idea for a phone case, I designed it and she didn't
    even buy it ðŸ˜¤.

      The Shakespeare pattern was the one she wanted.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I ended creating a few more designs, including some manually upscaling
    before AI upscaling was a thing. A few of these were discoverable on
    Redbubble, I enjoyed see the orders come in and paying for dinner
    every couple months.

  <h2>Gatsby Static Site</h2>
  <p>
    I created a quick site for my designs, though it had no effect on
    sales I'm sure. I was interested in Gatsby, so dug into all its cool
    features to toss together a mini-site.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <div class="fade-between">
      <img src="img/lit-acc/loading.webp" alt="Gatsby site loading with SVG placeholders." />
      <img src="img/lit-acc/loaded.webp" alt="Gatsby site with SVG loading" />
    </div>
    <figcaption>Pre-rendered SVGs fading into loaded assets</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The Gatsby Image element was new at the time, and allows for compile
    time operations to be performed on images. Here the images are
    posterized and saved inline as SVGs. The final image then fades in
    after its loaded.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was built when Gatsby hype was at its peak, and was great
    learning experience. The data layer was overkill for my needs and a
    bit inflexible for the other projects I tried it with (mainly around
    optional fields from CMSes).
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyways, saving this here for the memories, since I no longer wanna
    renew the domain.
