          I needed a white noise app to help a family member sleep, but all the
          existing ones had upsells. This mostly worked but Apple doesn't let
          PWAs play audio via the Web Audio APIs when locked.

          This project hit the edges of PWA capabilties, so I didn't ever get to
          use it much personally. But it demonstrates some cool browsers APIs
          such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="icon">üîä</span> Web Audio API</li>
          <li><span class="icon">üéöÔ∏è</span> Media Sessions API</li>

            Zustand State Management
            <small>Even though I used a destructing anti-pattern O_O</small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I unknownly re-invented
          <a
            href="https://jackyef.com/posts/building-an-audio-loop-player-on-the-web"
            >jackyef's project here</a
          >, which I found later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Creating seamless looping audio requires using the Web Audio API, as
          of writing. Using the Audio APIs to play sound instead of standard
          HTML markup allowed for EQ controls as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also utilizes the Media Sessions API to allow for audio control via
          the Mac menu bar, as well on the lock screen for supported devices.

        <p>
          It's up for now at
          <a href="https://soundsleeper.app">soundsleeper.app</a>, but I'll
          probably let it expire since I'm not using it at the moment.
