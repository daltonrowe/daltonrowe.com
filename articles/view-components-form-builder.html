  <p>
    I've been building a new Rails 8 application recently. I'm all in on View
    Components, and have enjoyed building it out as pure and Rails-y as
    possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came across a (documented) gotcha around using Rails Form Builders in View
    Components. Here's how I got the setup I want.
  </p>

  <h2>Setting default Form Builder in Rails View Components</h2>

  <code>
class ApplicationComponent < ViewComponent::Base 
  alias_method :original_form_with, :form_with 
  
  def form_with(**args, &block)
    original_form_with(**args, builder: MyFormBuilder, &block) 
  end 
end
  </code>

  <p>
    The above renames the <code>form_with</code> method to
    <code>original_form_with</code> to get it out of our way. It then inserts an
    extra <code>builder: MyFormBuilder</code>, so you never have to
    think about it again.
  </p>

  <h2>Rest of the Set Up</h2>

  <p>For posterity, here's the rest of my Rails View Component Form set up.</p>

  <code>
class MyFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
  def my_submit(**args, &block)
    defaults = {
      type: :submit
    }

    view_context.render MyButtonComponent.new(**defaults.merge(args))
  end

  private

  def view_context
    @view_context ||= ApplicationController.new.view_context
  end
end
  </code>

  <p>Allowing you to then use:</p>

  <code>
form_with ... do |form|
  form.my_submit
end
  </code>

  <p>Here we create a new Form Builder at <code>config/initializers/my_form_builder.rb</code> inheriting from the default.
  I've added a private method to get a controller ViewContext so we can render view components with no extra faffing about.</p>

  <code>
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  default_form_builder MyFormBuilder

  ...
end
  </code>

  <p>Lastly we set the default builder using the handy Rails <code>default_form_builder</code>, these folks thought of everything.</p>

  <h2>Extra Context + Sources</h2>

  <p>This was an <a href="https://viewcomponent.org/known_issues.html#forms-dont-use-the-default-formbuilder">intentional decision</a> to prevent unexpected changes to rendering behavior</p>

  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.mendelowski.com/til/2024/02/rendering-view-component-from-form-builder">Lucas Mendelowski</a> for the helpful article on how to easily slot VCs into Form Builders, shown above.</p>
