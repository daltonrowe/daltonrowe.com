<p>A few things I'm proud of in the Yellowberri 3.0 website.</p>

    I didn't know it had fireworks! I told my wife, she was very
    supportive.

  At Yellowberri I worked with WordPress a lot, and was lucky enough to
  find Advanced Custom Fields early on. We primarily worked on information
  based (brochure) websites for small to medium sized businesses.

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>
  I learned an immeasurble amount during that time, especially about what
  kind of websites get updated, and those that don't. That's worth a whole
  other post. But anyways, I aimed to make a new Yellowberri website that
  was, in order:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="icon">üéâ</span> going to recieve updates</li>
  <li><span class="icon">‚ö°Ô∏è</span>fast</li>
  <li><span class="icon">üåü</span>flashy</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I think is neat</h2>

<h3>WordPress Backend</h3>
<p>
  WordPress + ACF, in my opinion provides an unequaled backend CMS
  experience for users whose primary occupation is not updating websites.
  Many website maintainers are familiar with WordPress in advance even!
</p>

<h3>Static Compatible</h3>
<p>
  While not currently deployed as such, the 3.0 site can be turned into a
  static site with a simple wget + find and replace. The site utilizes
  Formspree for simple contact forms with no additional Javascript.
</p>

<h3>Prepared for Social Media</h3>
<p>
  Small standalone websites mean nothing without distribution. I've found
  one the killer app of on-site blog posts is control over Open Graph
  images and titles for distribution on social channels. The CMS
  experience is a Pass/Fail test for utilization, so using intuitive tools
  and defaults is a must.
</p>

<h3>Solid Lighthouse Scores</h3>
<p>
  On launch scores, were pinned at 100 across the board! I was very happy
  to have achieved that in a live production site. After install third
  party scripts the score dropped a few points, but still firmly in the
  green.
</p>

<h3>Lottie / Bodymovin Integration</h3>
<p>
  Built from the start to support inline SVG and Bodymovin animations, the
  3.0 sites supports updating designs straight from After Effects or
  Illustrator via the WordPress backend.
</p>

<h3>Page Animations</h3>
<p>
  While admittedly a bit flashy, I think it's okay for an advertising
  site. The JS splits a Bodymovin animation by frames and randomizes the
  entry and exit. Featuring homespun page replacement AJAX to allow for
  page transitions between server rendered pages.
</p>

<h2>Best part</h2>
<p>
  It's getting used! It took a long time to get launched but I'm glad it's
  out for now :)
