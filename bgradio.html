          Bowling Green is a tertiary city in Kentucky where I went to college
          and met a beautiful group of people. BG has a grip of talented
          musicians creating art and performing live.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I transplant to BG, I got to know some of these people, and heard
          from them about the previous eras of music in BG, and their musical
          influences that are no longer active.
        </p>

            Creating the bgrad.io brand was one of my fav parts.

        <p>
          This experience led to me to create an database of local bands and
          musicians, reach out to them and get their permission to stream their
          music.
        </p>

        <h2>Iteration 1: Youtube Stream</h2>

        <p>
          The first version of bgrad.io was a 24/7 Youtube stream. These streams
          were popular at the time with <em>beats to relax/study to</em> leading
          the charge.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/bgrad/stream.jpg" alt="Youtube version of bgrad.io" />

        <p>
          V1 was composed of some node scripts, a web interface, and OBS. I had
          a poor little Mac mini chugging away in my office for days at a time.
          Uptime was decent, but occasionally the next song would not play due
          to bugs in the node scripts.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>The Youtube stream had some cool features:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="icon">üñºÔ∏è</span> Album art display</li>
          <li><span class="icon">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è</span> Art and title animation</li>
          <li><span class="icon">üéº</span> Album and artist information</li>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">üé•</span> Music videos support when available
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">üßë‚Äçüè´</span> Interesting facts displayed per album
            and artist
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Iteration 2: Azuracast Server</h2>

        <p>
          Eventually, I got tired having to host the stream locally in my own
          home. Occasional connection issues as well as network and power usage
          was less than ideal. To say nothing of the eventual copyright strikes
          I would attract on Youtube, despite having explicit permission from
          the rights holders.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I looked into rebuilding bgrad.io as a hostable internet radio
          station. I found <a href="https://www.azuracast.com/">Azuracast</a>, a
          great easy to roll streaming solution. I tossed it on a Digital Ocean
          droplet and redid the website, and let people know.
        </p>

          />

        <p>
          The response was much greater this time, and people shared how they
          enjoyed getting to rediscover artists they hadn't heard in decades.
        </p>

        <p>Hopefully I revive this again in some form or another one day.</p>
