        <p>
          I made a real world game using Raspberry Pi’s, NFC readers, LED
          strips, and Supabase. The goal of the game is to capture and hold and
          many capture points as you can, stealing them back from other players,
          and sneaking off the gain control for your team.

        <h2>The Game</h2>

        <p>
          “Multi Hill King of the Hill” / “Control Points” is the best one
          phrase explainers I’ve found so far. The goal is to capture areas for
          your team by swiping your NFC card at the control point.
        </p>

          A friend of mine runs a
          <a href="https://kindaspoopy.com/">small music fest</a>, and uses LEDs
          distributed around a campground to provide atmospheric lighting for
          the event. I thought some cool interactive games could be created
          using this setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          An optional scoreboard can then display captured areas as well as a
          leaderboard.

        <h2>The Tech</h2>

        <p>Each node / "hill" consists of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 3B+</li>
          <li>WS2182 Light Strip</li>
          <li>RC522 NFC Reader / Writer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I love working with Raspberry Pi as I enjoy working in strong,
          well-trodden ecosystems. They are often overkill for projects, but its
          great to continue working in a familiar Linux environment.
        </p>

          <img
            src="img/capturetag/ct-setup.jpg"
            alt="Setting up CaptureTag NFC cards for the first play test"
            class="gap-bottom"
          />
          <figcaption>
            NFC cards and a Raspberry Pi node being setup for play.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          I built this version in NodeJS, with the help of some awesome
          packages, namely
          <a href="https://github.com/beyondscreen/node-rpi-ws281x-native"
            >node-rpi-ws281x-native</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/firsttris/mfrc522-rpi">mfrc522-rpi</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each card has a hex-encoded string written to it that decodes to
          something like `B-taco`. The first letter being the team, and second
          being the player's code name.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a scan happens the Pi debounces the scan event (as they can
          happen in quick succession) and then shoots up the data to a
          <a href="supabase.com">Supabase</a> project with a few endpoints. A
          lot of fun insights can be derived from the data, see the playtest
          below for what I pulled out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Game sessions, node assignment, and project endpoints can be managed
          via a super rough dashboard I slapped together. I enjoyed working
          framework free and keeping it as barebones as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scoreboard page uses Supabase Realtime to provide instant updates
          to the capture state of each node, as well as keep the leaderboard up
          to date.

      <section id="playtest">
        <h2>Playtest</h2>

        <p>
          I was planning to have a get-together with my friends in an Airbnb,
          and I realized that would be perfect opportunity to try out the game!
        </p>

        <h3>Teaching</h3>

        <p>
          I didn’t get a representative experience of introducing the game to
          players as all involved were close friends and more or less taught
          each other. However I did learn a few things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Show Don't Tell:
            <small>
              All the words in the world didn’t compare to swiping a card and
              seeing the color on the point change. The actual demo following by
              a suggestion of how to be competitive got people interesting and
              playing right away.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            Personally Relevant Goals First:

            <small>
              Intially, I started introducing the team goals like holding the
              point for your team and total capture time. But quickly I realized
              players cared more about their personal actions and contributions,
              so I started introducing that first.
            </small>

            <small>
              I’m still personally interested in the team aspect so I’ll likely
              spend time juicing the experience of contributing to one’s team
              with team leaderboards and other stats.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Player Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          I got tons of great feedback as I discussed with players, each had
          their different play styles and focused on different parts of the
          game.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Desire for Leaderboard:
            <small>
              Universally, all players wanted to see who had the scans.
              Initially the scoreboard only showed which team held each point.
              Much like a competitive online game, team progress is great but
              players want to see their own points.
            </small>

            <small>
              Implementing the leaderboard was the only change I made over the
              course of the weekend.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            Lockout Time:
            <small>
              “Steals” happened pretty frequently. Players would capture a
              point, and then another competitive player would sneak up right
              behind them and recapture the point. Several players brought up
              that a lockout time would feel better, so their progress wouldn’t
              immediately be wiped away.
            </small>

            <small>
              I like this idea, but will likely implement it with a light touch
              as not to discourage the highly engaged stealing players.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            Genuine Product Direction from Players:
            <small>
              Gathering feedback from players was very gratifying and
              stimulating for me. Being on the ground with players having
              discussions and combined with the agency to make any changes I
              felt necessary was a beautiful taste of true user focused design.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parsing Data</h3>

        <p>
          A few days after the game was complete I parsed out all the scan
          events to determine the winner, as well as some interesting stats!
        </p>

        <img
          src="img/capturetag/ct-stats.png"
          alt="Most captures by team"
          class="gap-bottom"
        />

        <img
          src="img/capturetag/ct-captures.png"
          alt="Most captures by team"
          class="gap-bottom"
        />

        <img
          src="img/capturetag/ct-time.png"
          alt="Total capture time"
          class="gap-bottom"
        />

        <p>
          Team based stats were less interesting in this playtest, but I think
          with the right visiblity team based play could be made really fun for
          players.
        </p>

      <section id="next-steps">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>
          As I have time I want to polish the game, to make it as beautiful a
          process as possible, moreso than expanding with new features. Here are
          a few things that I've been ruminating on:
        </p>

        <h3>Improvements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Local server support
            <small
              >There's not really a need to a central online server, I could
              instead use a command node and keep the game local to the
              network.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Use GUIDs + registration flow to remove the need to burn cards
            <small>
              Currently each card must be burnt with a team code and player
              name, just use the built in GUIDs instead and register each card
              to a user name.
            </small>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add lock out time with visual indication
            <small
              >As mentioned, prevent instant steals from watchful players.
              There's opportunity for a high afforance design, gradually fading
              into the new colors.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Control external API providing lights
            <small
              >To control a larger universe of lights, have a local command node
              find and set lighting for node zones.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Shrink nodes from Pi to ESP32
            <small
              >Raspberry Pi is super duper overkill for these little scanner
              nodes.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Prevent Partial Scans

            <small>
              Sometime I recieved partial scans from the NFC cards. I'm not sure
              why this happens but there ways to check for and prevent this.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rediscovering playground mentalities
            <small
              >The childlike playground mentality is essential when thinking
              about and explaining games. It took a minute to get back into but
              I loved living in that space during the playtest.</small
            >
            <small
              >Intially the game was called "Lumi" but "CaptureTag" (as
              suggested by my friend Tim) explains itself and communicate the
              correct level of anti-serious playfulness.</small
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            Competing for Most Scans is Fun
            <small
              >Players talked the most about on upping each other, and loved
              seeing their numbers go up!</small
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            Players Lose Cards
            <small>Be able to ready to make backups :)</small>
          </li>

          <li>
            Prevent Burn In
            <small
              >When displaying the leaderboard on a TV, have tools to prevent
              burnin, such as a slight wiggle and dark mode.</small
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Thanks for Reading!</h2>
        <p>
          Creating an physical game with the tools of my incredibly virtual
          trade was very gratifying. I'm excited to continue into the realm of
          less productized tech.
