          Imagine playing king of the hill as a kid, but when you capture the
          hill the whole landscape around you is illuminated with light and
          color. That's the big vision for this small game prototype.

          I wanted to make a game, that takes place in the real world involving
          no phones or other devices.

        <p>
          Built with Raspberry Pi’s, NFC readers, LED strips, and Supabase. The
          goal of the game is to capture and hold and many capture points as you
          can, stealing them back from other players, and sneaking off the gain
          control for your team.

        <h2>The Game</h2>

        <p>
          “Multi Hill King of the Hill” is the best one phrase explainer I’ve
          found so far. The goal is to capture areas for your team by swiping
          your NFC card at the control point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Players compete for control of each zone, both to gain their team
          capture time as well as capture points for themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          An scoreboard then displays captured areas as well as a leaderboard.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tech</h2>

        <p>Each node / "hill" consists of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 3B+</li>
          <li>WS2182 Light Strip</li>
          <li>RC522 NFC Reader / Writer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I enjoy working within Raspberry Pi well-trodden ecosystem. They are
          often overkill for projects, but its great to continue working in a
          familiar Linux environment.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/capturetag/ct-setup.jpg"
            alt="Setting up CaptureTag NFC cards for the first play test"
          />
          <figcaption>
            NFC cards and a Raspberry Pi node being setup for play.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The capture point is written in NodeJS, with the help of some awesome
          packages, namely
          <a href="https://github.com/beyondscreen/node-rpi-ws281x-native"
            >node-rpi-ws281x-native</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/firsttris/mfrc522-rpi">mfrc522-rpi</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each card has a hex-encoded string written to it that decodes to
          something like `B-taco`. The first letter being the team, and second
          being the player's code name.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a scan happens the Pi debounces the scan event (as they can
          happen in quick succession) and then shoots up the data to a simple
          <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a> project with a few
          endpoints. A lot of fun insights can be derived from the data, see the
          play test below for what I pulled out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each scan event is stored as an event queue so that game node are
          mostly stateless and the data can be replayed and parsed later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Game sessions, node assignment, and project endpoints can be managed
          via a super rough dashboard I slapped together. I enjoyed working
          framework free and keeping it as barebones as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scoreboard page uses
          <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime"
            >Supabase Realtime</a
          >
          to provide instant updates to the capture state of each node, as well
          as keep the leaderboard up to date.

        <h2>play test</h2>

        <p>
          I was planning to have a get-together with my friends in an Airbnb,
          and I realized that would be perfect opportunity to try out the game!
        </p>

        <h3>Teaching</h3>

        <p>
          I didn’t get a representative experience of introducing the game to
          players as all involved were close friends and more or less taught
          each other. However I did learn a few things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">🖼️</span>
            Show Don't Tell
            <small>
              All the words in the world didn’t compare to swiping a card and
              seeing the color on the point change. The actual demo following by
              a suggestion of how to be competitive got people interesting and
              playing right away.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="icon">🙋</span>
            Personally Relevant Goals First
            <small>
              Intially, I started introducing the team goals like holding the
              point for your team and total capture time. But quickly I realized
              players cared more about their personal actions and contributions,
              so I started introducing that first.
            </small>

            <small>
              I’m still personally interested in the team aspect so I’ll likely
              spend time juicing the experience of contributing to one’s team
              with team leaderboards and other stats.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Player Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          I got tons of great feedback as I discussed with players, each had
          their different play styles and focused on different parts of the
          game.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">🏆</span>
            Desire for Leaderboard
            <small>
              Universally, all players wanted to see who had the most scans. I
              incorrectly assumed team play was more interesting but quickly
              pivoted.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="icon">🔒</span>
            Lockout Time
            <small>
              “Steals” happened frequently. Players capture a point, and then
              another competitive player would sneak up right behind them and
              recapture the point.
            </small>

            <small
              >Several players brought up that a lockout time would feel better,
              so their progress wouldn’t immediately be wiped away.</small
            >

            <small>
              I like this idea, but will likely implement it with a light touch
              as not to discourage the highly engaged stealing players.
            </small>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="icon">📝</span>
            Genuine Product Direction from Players
            <small>
              Gathering feedback directly from engaged players was a rush. Being
              surrounded with players having discussions and combined with the
              agency to make any changes I felt necessary was a beautiful taste
              of true user focused design.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parsing Data</h3>

        <p>
          A few days after the game was complete I parsed out all the scan
          events to determine the winner, as well as some interesting stats!
        </p>

        <img src="img/capturetag/ct-stats.png" alt="Most captures by team" />

        <img src="img/capturetag/ct-captures.png" alt="Most captures by team" />

        <img src="img/capturetag/ct-time.png" alt="Total capture time" />

        <p>
          Team based stats were less interesting in this play test, but I think
          with the right visibility team based play could be made really fun for
          players.
        </p>

      <section id="next-steps">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>
          As I have time I want to polish the game, to make it as beautiful a
          process as possible, more so than expanding with new features. Here
          are a few things that I've been ruminating on:
        </p>

        <h3>Improvements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">📡</span>
            Local server support
            <small
              >There's not really a need to a central online server, I could
              instead use a command node and keep the game local to the
              network.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="icon">🔧</span>
            Use GUIDs + registration flow to Setup Cards
            <small>
              Currently each card must be burnt with a team code and player
              name, just use the built in GUIDs instead and register each card
              to a user name.
            </small>
          </li>

            Add Lock Out time with Visual Effects
            <small
              >As mentioned, prevent instant steals from watchful players.
              There's opportunity for a high affordance design, gradually fading

            Prevent Partial Scans
            <small>
              Sometime I received partial scans from the NFC cards. I'm not sure
              why this happens but there ways to check for and prevent this.

            Rediscovering Playground Mentalities
            <small>
              The childlike playground mentality is essential when thinking
              about and explaining games. It took a minute to get back into but
              I loved living in that space during the play test.
            </small>
            <small>
              Initially the game was called "Lumi" but "CaptureTag" (as
              suggested by my friend Tim) explains itself and communicate the
              correct level of anti-serious playfulness.

            Competing for Most Scans is Fun
            <small>
              Players talked the most about on upping each other, and loved
              seeing their numbers go up!

        <p>
          Creating an physical game with the tools of my incredibly virtual
          trade was very gratifying.
        </p>

        <p>
          My side project mindset in the past has been very business focussed,
          and I'm excited to build more projects around providing fun and
          pleasure than extracting money.
