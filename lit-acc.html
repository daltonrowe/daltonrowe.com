          My wife had an idea for a phone case, I designed it and she didn't
          even buy it üò§.

            The Shakespeare pattern was the one she wanted.

          I ended creating a few more designs, including some manually upscaling
          before AI upscaling was a thing. A few of these were discoverable on
          Redbubble, I enjoyed see the orders come in and paying for dinner
          every couple months.

        <h2>Gatsby Static Site</h2>
        <p>
          I created a quick site for my designs, though it had no effect on
          sales I'm sure. I was interested in Gatsby, so dug into all its cool
          features to toss together a mini-site.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/lit-acc/loading.jpg"
            alt="Gatsby site loading with SVG placeholders."
          />

          The Gatsby Image element was new at the time, and allow for compile
          time operations to be performed on images. Here the images are
          posterized and saved inline as SVGs. The final image then fades in
          after its loaded.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was built when Gatsby hype was at its peak, and was great
          learning experience. The data layer was overkill for my needs and a
          bit inflexible for the other projects I tried it with (mainly around
          optional fields from CMSes).
        </p>

          Anyways, saving this here for the memories, since I no longer wanna
          renew the domain.
