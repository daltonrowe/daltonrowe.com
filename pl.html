      <h2>Every public library deserves a great website.</h2>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        Public libariries are key factors in technology and internet education, we should seek to give back to these amazing institutions.
        <em>The Public Library Website Project</em> is a charitable initiative to develop and deploy quality websites for any public library that needs one.
      </p>

      <h2>The Goal.</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Public Library Website Project</em> seeks to do the following:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="gap-bottom">
        <li>
          Develop and document a quality WordPress theme suited to public libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide training resources and direct support to libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide cost-effective hosting services for public library sites.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <p>
        Hey I'm Dalton Rowe. I've been making websites for the last 10 years. 
        I've been lucky enough to make five public library websites, each and every one a great learning experience.
        Public libraries <em>really</em> use their websites, and any service supporting them needs to provide quality tools for all aspects of library websites.
      </p>

      <p>My dream is to work hand in hand with local libraries, building a quality website framework to match their needs.</p>
