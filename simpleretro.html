          Another in a series of side projects scratching my own itches. Every
          sprint our Product Manager would complain about not being able to find
          a simple retro tool that allows for ranking by number of votes.

          I was enjoying working with Firebase at the time, so I whipped up a
          quick tool with only the features we needed:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="icon">😎</span> Masking user's feedback</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📡</span> Realtime editing</li>
          <li><span class="icon">🗳️</span> Vote limiting</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📚</span> Sort by votes / recency</li>
          <li><span class="icon">🖇️</span> Combining similar feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We got some nice use out of this guy. I designed some of the systems
          around the good faith of participants, some of the logic around card
          masking and maximum votes lives in the frontend. None of the
          developers involved got overly curious at what they might be able to
          affect but it's only a matter of time.

          />

          Firebase is great for throwing together apps really quickly. This
          project explored use of Firebase's Firestore emulation for a test
          suite which is quite ergonomic, as well as some handrolled
          "migrations" which were less so 🙂.
