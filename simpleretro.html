          Another in a series of side projects scratching my own itches. Every
          sprint our Product Manager would complain about not being able to find
          a simple retro tool that allows for ranking by number of votes.

        <p>
          I was enjoying working with Firebase at the time, so whipped up a
          quick tool with only the features we needed.

          We got some nice use out of this guy. I designed some of the systems
          around the good faith of participants, some of the logic around card
          masking and maximum votes lives in the frontend. None of the
          developers involved got overly curious at what they might be able to
          affect but it's only a matter of time.

          <img
            src="img/simpleretro/user.webp"
            alt="A retro participant's view"
          />
          <figcaption>A retro participant's view</figcaption>

        <p>
          Not too much here, but does feature a minimal test suite using
          Firebase's Firestore emulation which is quite ergonomic, as well as
          some handrolled "migrations" which were less so üôÇ.
