<p>Losing access to Adobe products felt like losing a pinky finger. Three or four years on I still think in the
  operations of the Adobe tool set.</p>

<p>As I dig in 3D printing, Iâ€™m making a concentrated effort to only work with free and open source software as much as
  possible so that I can avoid that loss of *personal utility* because I never had ownership in the first place</p>

<p>So far its going great, @blender.org and @openscad.bsky.social
  have been and absolute joy. What most people think of a "quality" in software is actually just familiarity, so why not
  get familiar with things I can own.</p>
