      <p>A few things I'm proud of in the Yellowberri 3.0 website.</p>

          I didn't know it had fireworks! I told my wife, she was very
          supportive.

      <p>
        At Yellowberri I worked with WordPress a lot, and was lucky enough to
        find Advanced Custom Fields early on. We primarily worked on information
        based (brochure) websites for small to medium sized businesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Putting it all together</h2>

      <img src="img/ybsite1.png" alt="Yellowberri Website" />

      <p>
        I learned an immeasurble amount during that time, especially about what
        kind of websites get updated, and those that don't. That's worth a whole
        other post. But anyways, I aimed to make a new Yellowberri website that
        was, in order:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="icon">üéâ</span> going to recieve updates</li>
        <li><span class="icon">‚ö°Ô∏è</span>fast</li>
        <li><span class="icon">üåü</span>flashy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I think is neat</h2>

      <h3>WordPress Backend</h3>
      <p>
        WordPress + ACF, in my opinion provides an unequaled backend CMS
        experience for users whose primary occupation is not updating websites.
        Many website maintainers are familiar with WordPress in advance even!
      </p>

      <h3>Static Compatible</h3>
      <p>
        While not currently deployed as such, the 3.0 site can be turned into a
        static site with a simple wget + find and replace. The site utilizes
        Formspree for simple contact forms with no additional Javascript.
      </p>

      <h3>Prepared for Social Media</h3>
      <p>
        Small standalone websites mean nothing without distribution. I've found
        one the killer app of on-site blog posts is control over Open Graph
        images and titles for distribution on social channels. The CMS
        experience is a Pass/Fail test for utilization, so using intuitive tools
        and defaults is a must.
      </p>

      <h3>Solid Lighthouse Scores</h3>
      <p>
        On launch scores, were pinned at 100 across the board! I was very happy
        to have achieved that in a live production site. After install third
        party scripts the score dropped a few points, but still firmly in the
        green.
      </p>

      <h3>Lottie / Bodymovin Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Built from the start to support inline SVG and Bodymovin animations, the
        3.0 sites supports updating designs straight from After Effects or
        Illustrator via the WordPress backend.
      </p>

      <h3>Page Animations</h3>
      <p>
        While admittedly a bit flashy, I think it's okay for an advertising
        site. The JS splits a Bodymovin animation by frames and randomizes the
        entry and exit. Featuring homespun page replacement AJAX to allow for
        page transitions between server rendered pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Best part</h2>
      <p>
        It's getting used! It took a long time to get launched but I'm glad it's
        out for now :)
